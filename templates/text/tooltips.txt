{TMT_INFLUENCE_LEVEL_0}A stuffed olive has more influence than this man - it could choke someone important and change history.
{TMT_INFLUENCE_LEVEL_1}This man has almost no influence over his dinner menu at home, let alone his life and the fate of the world.
{TMT_INFLUENCE_LEVEL_2}This man's opinions carry little weight. He is simply regarded as something of a duffer.
{TMT_INFLUENCE_LEVEL_3}This man is of scant importance. He occasionally says sensible things, but the occasions are few.
{TMT_INFLUENCE_LEVEL_4}Sometimes this man's counsel carries weight, and his opinion is sought on carefully selected matters.
{TMT_INFLUENCE_LEVEL_5}This man's word carries weight in the lesser palaces of the world, although the truly mighty largely ignore him.

{TMT_SUBTERFUGE_LEVEL_8}This man has a mind of serpentine complexity, and is able to create and penetrate the most cunning of plots.
{TMT_SUBTERFUGE_LEVEL_9}This man's plots are all masterpieces of feints within feints, hidden within other conspiracies.
