; JNF 2021-02-10 - I've removed all instances of the "General_1" voice type from here. If a general
;                  is contained within a unit they will override the voice anyway, and this way I
;                  can make it so that if a general dies the unit voice will change to reflect that,
;                  which I think is cool, at least.
; JNF 2021-04-15 - I've corrected all the animal IDs here to actually be IDs, since they were previously just using classes which were then turned into ids
;                  which meant it was impossible to add new animals, which is fixed now
; JNF 2021-05-27 - FEDU and EDU have been reunited together into just EDU, now to define a remastered unit you just need to have a partial definition:
;                  add a line for "rebalance_statblock" after the unit you want to edit, then redefine everything between "soldier" and "stat_cost"
;                  (minus "officer", "mount", "ship", "engine", or "animal") and the game will automatically duplicate the other properties.
; JNF 2021-10-06 - Replaced all instances of general_unit_upgrade with general_unit_upgrade "marian_reforms", so we can specify multiple general unit upgrades
